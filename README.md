Practicalities
--------------
Since all chapters are located in a subdirectory please use the following command to refer to image or code folders:

```latex
\imageSrc
\codeSrc
```
You can temporarily redefine these command when compiling a chapter individually inside the chapter directory. Please don't forget to remove them before committing in order to allow everyone to compile the main tex-file.
